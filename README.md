# Document-Reader-Application
A simple Python based document reader application built with Streamlit. I have used only OCR, NLP and Regex but this application can be made better by using AI.

## Features
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** – Extracts text from uploaded images or scanned documents.
- NLP and Regex Matching– To extract specific information like Name, ID number etc.
- Streamlit – Runs in your browser with an interactive interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- OCR – `pytesseract`
- NLP – `nltk` / `spacy`
- Regex – Built-in Python `re` library
- Streamlit – Web interface
